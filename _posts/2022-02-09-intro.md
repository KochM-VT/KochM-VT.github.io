# Introduction
===
Hi! If you happen to come across this webpage somehow, my name is Michael Koch, and I'm a Computer Engineer with some mild experience in analog and digital ASIC and system design. If you're reading this after about June 2022, I'm probably working for Texas Instruments as a Validation Engineer somewhere in the massive metroplex that is the Dallas-Fort Worth area. If you're reading this before then, I'm finishing my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech.

As for me personally, I'm an electronic hobbyist and a moderately competent programmer (my favorite languages are C and C++, though I'm of the opinion that any programming language can be useful if you use it for what it's intended). I also play video games sometimes (though far less often than I'd like), of which a few of my favorites are Beat Saber, Pavlov, Civ 5, and the games in the Mount & Blade series. 

Though I initially started this site as an extra credit assignment for a GUI programming class, I plan to use it as a sort of blog and a place to rant and post about things I'm learning, am interested in, or have been developing in what spare time I may have. The first few posts will probably either be about symmetric cryptography or control of open-loop unstable systems.

If you happen to be looking for a Digital Design Engineer and are located in either DFW, Austin, or Colorado Springs, feel free to take a look at my [resume](https:://kochm-vt.github.io/resume.html)!
